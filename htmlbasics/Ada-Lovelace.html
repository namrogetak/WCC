    <p>Ada Lovelace was a 19th Century mathematician and writer who is  considered to be the first computer programmer. She worked with inventor and mathematician Charles Babbage on theories for the "Analytical Engine," a proposed mechanical computing device. Lovelace introduced many computing concepts, and she is credited as the first to recognize the Analytical Engine could have applications beyond calculation.
